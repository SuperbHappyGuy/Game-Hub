# Game Hub
<p>Game Hub is a website to showcase the games I have made and games I will be making in the future! Game Hub is a project that is intended for learning purposes of raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help me understand some of the fundamentals of web development. You can check it out here: https://superbgames.netlify.app/</p>

## Game List
<ul>
  <li>Picross</li>
  <li>Merge Mainia</li>
</ul>

### Picross
<p>Picross is a logic puzzle game where you follow hint numbers to fill a grid to complete a puzzle. You can check out the source code here: https://github.com/SuperbHappyGuy/Picross-Game</p>

### Merge Mainia
<p>Merge Mainia is a game inspired by the game 2048. You choose what column to add a number to while the screen gets pushed to the bottom. If the numbers touch the bottom of the screen it's game over so start merging numbers to prevent game over. <br> This is a webgl game that isn't my work and is embeded from https://business.gamezop.com/html5-games and is intended to add more content to the website while games of my own are being developed.</p>
